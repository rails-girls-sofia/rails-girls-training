					<h2>Get Ready</h2>
					<p> To build apps and other things with Ruby on Rails, you need to set up <strong>2 accounts</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>We need somewhere for you to write code and run a server, and we need somewhere for you to store and share your code so you can work with other people.

						<p>	GitHub is a way to store and share your code.</p>
						<p> With Github, you can keep track of all the changes you make and collaborate with other people.</p>
						<p><strong><a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Go to Github.com</a></strong></p>
						<p>Tell GitHub your email address, pick a username and password, and sign up.</p>

					<section data-background="images/halftone.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
						<p>GitHub is a service that helps you to store and track your code. It runs using a system called 'Git'.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/halftone.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
						<p>Git manages your project, including all the files you make, as they change over time.</p>
						<p>Git stores this information in something called a 'repository'.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/halftone.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
						<p>A repository stores a copy of your project. It also records every change you make to your project. These changes are called 'commits'.</p>
						<p>This means you can look at your commit history, to see what changes you've made to your project, and when you made them.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/halftone.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
						<p>When you first create your project, you've got the only copy of it. This is bad, because if something happened to your computer, you might lose everything you've made.</p>
						<p>Committing your project using Github (via Git) means you've got a backup copy just in case anything goes wrong.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/halftone.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
						<p>The other great thing about this is that you can always go back to an old version of your project, so if you make a mistake, or change your mind about something you've done, you can easily fix it.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/halftone.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
						<p>GitHub also allows you to collaborate on projects. If you and your friend wanted to build something together, you could work on your own computers, committing changes to GitHub as you made them.</p>
						<p>GitHub lets you know if you've both tried to change the same thing, so you can pick which copy you want to use.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/halftone.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
						<p>Once we've done some work on our project, we'll commit it to GitHub. However, if you want to try out some of the commands you'll be using, <a href="https://try.github.io" target="_blank">check out this tutorial.</a>

					<h2>Nitrous.io</h2>
					<p>Every craftsman needs a certain set of tools in his workshop.</p>
					<p>Normally, developers install software on their computer and use Terminal and a text editor to write code. This is perfectly OK, but it takes a bit more time to set up.</p>
					<p>We're not making you obtain the necessary tools and build your own workshop just for this demonstration. Instead, we'll let you use a fully working workshop, with all the necessary tools already available. This means we can start making magic straight away.</p>
					<p>We're going to use a shortcut by coding in Nitrous.io.</p>
					<p>Set up your <a href="http://railsgirls-my.github.io/nitrous/" target="_blank">Nitrous.io account by following this guide</a>.</p>

				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>We need to create some folders to store our app in.</p>
					<p>In the terminal type:</p>
					<pre><code>mkdir projects</code></pre>
					<p>The 'mkdir' command means 'make directory'. So, we've made a directory called 'projects'.

					<p>Now, we need to access the directory we made.</p>
					<p>In the terminal type:</p>
					<pre><code>cd projects</code></pre>
					<p>The 'cd' command means 'change directory'. We're now in the 'projects' directory.</p>
					<p>The 'projects' directory is usually used to store all your different coding projects.</p>

					<p>We're going to make an app called Rails Girls.</p>
					<p>In the terminal type:</p>
					<pre><code>rails new railsgirls -m http://railsgirls.com/simple_scaffold.rb</code></pre>
					<p>The '<code>rails new</code>' command creates a new rails app.</p>
					<p>The <code>-m http://railsgirls.com/simple_scaffold.rb</code> part tells Rails to download a special template from railsgirls.com which makes the files a bit simpler and easier for beginners to understand.</p>

				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>One of the great things about Rails is that it comes with some built-in things that make it super easy to get going. One of these is scaffolds. Scaffolds let you easily add new concepts (like users, posts and comments) in one command.</p>
					<p>The scaffold command creates all the necessary code files you need to work with that concept. This includes database tables to store information in, and instructions for how it needs to interact with other parts of your app.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>In the terminal, type:<p>

				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>You've now created a concept (model) called 'idea' that includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A name.</li>
						<li>A description.</li>
						<li>A picture.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The 'string' and 'text' parts tell the app what type of data it will be.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>There are lots of different types of data you might include, such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>:binary</code> - stores data such as images, audio files or movies.</li>
						<li><code>:boolean</code> - stores true or false values (such as whether a particular user is an administrator of an application or not).</li>
						<li><code>:date</code> - stores only a date (year, month, day).</li>
						<li><code>:datetime</code> - stores both a date and a time.</li>
						<li><code>:integer</code> - stores whole numbers.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>When we add new concepts like these to our app, we need to update our database. This is called a migration.</p>

				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">

					<h2>Making things beautiful </h2>
					<h4>(or, the front-end)</h4>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>In a Ruby on Rails application, the user interface (what someone visiting the website will see), is often written in HTML with Embedded Ruby (ERB) code.</p>
					<p>This code is contained in a specific directory called â€˜viewsâ€™, located in the app folder of your Rails application directory.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the main language used to write the things displayed in a web browser. HTML includes content, and tags to structure the content. <br>These tags come in pairs (an open and a close tag). <br>For example, the main heading on your page will have <code>&lt;h1&gt;tags&lt;/h1&gt;</code> around it.</p>
					<p>HTML tags use angular brackets <code> < ></code>.</p>
					<p>Your web browser uses the tags to understand how to display content.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>ERB is a system supplied by Ruby that allows you to insert pure Ruby code into files written in other languages, such as Javascript or HTML. The Ruby code is contained within specific angle brackets <code><%</code> and <code>%></code> which instruct the system to execute the contents.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>If an = sign accompanies the angle brackets <code><%=</code> and <code>%></code>, <br>then the contents are executed and rendered on the page.</p>
					<p>For example, if you had 25 active ideas in your application, the code:</p>
					<pre><code>There are currently <%= Idea.count %> active ideas</code></pre>
					<p>would render as: There are currently 25 active ideas.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>Earlier, we ran a scaffold command to set up our app. <br>As well as creating our model, it also created a controller, and a view.</p>
					<p>When someone connects to your Rails website, the request the browser sends to the server hits the controller you've created. The controller communicates with the model (and the model with the database) to get the information needed. It then sends that information to the view, which returns the HTML to the requesting browser, so they can see your site.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>All the things we've talked about so far involve the content of our website, <br>and the structure of that content.</p>
					<p>The next piece of the puzzle is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is used to format/style <br>our website, so that it looks beautiful and is nice to use.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>In Nitrous.io, the left side of the page has a tree menu. Use this to open <code>app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</code> in your text editor. <br>This is a default layout file. You can use this to create default formatting for your app.
					</p>
					<p>Find the line <code><%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %></code>. Above this line, add this code:</p>
					<pre><code><link rel="stylesheet" href="//railsgirls.com/assets/bootstrap.css" />

				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>The <code>rel="stylesheet"</code> tells us the type of link we've just added (called the link relation). The <code>href=</code> tells us the address of the file (this is called the hypertext reference). We're using a stylesheet called 'Bootstrap', made by Twitter.

					<p>The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is used to divide your code into parts.</p>
					<p>You can also assign a class. This allows you to apply the same styling <br>to all the things with this class. We've called ours 'container'.</p>
					<p><code class=" hljs xml"><%= yield %></code> is a way of adding the unique content we'll have on each page into the container. This helps make sure our styling is consistent.

				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>We want to have a navigation bar at the top of our page, so that people using our app can find their way around. We also want to have a footer at the bottom of the page. <br>In the same file, under <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> add:</p>

					<p><code>body</code> - this part is known as the selector and refers to the HTML element you wish to style.</p>

					<p>Declarations always end with a semicolon and declaration groups <br>are always enclosed by curly brackets.</p>

					<h2>Images</h2>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>In our app, we want to be able to upload images. At the moment, we can't do that.</p>
					<p>Rails has lots of useful add ons you can use. In programming, these are usually called libraries, but in Rails, we call them gems. Gems contain pre-written code and help to reduce errors and duplication in your code.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>In your project menu, you'll see something called <code>Gemfile</code>. <br>This has all the gems that came with the application we created.</p>
					<p>Open gemfile so you can edit it in the text editor. Under the line <code>gem 'sqlite3'</code>, add:</p>
					<pre><code>gem 'carrierwave'</code></pre>
					<p>The <code>sqlite3 gem</code> interfaces with our database, and <code>carrierwave</code> <br>makes it easier to upload images.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>In the terminal, run:</p>
					<pre><code>bundle</code></pre>
					<p>This runs Rails' Bundler software, which fetches the gems you have <br>added from the <a href="https://rubygems.org" target="_blank">https://rubygems.org</a> website, and installs them.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>Now, we can generate the code for uploading pictures. In the terminal, type:</p>
					<pre><code>rails generate uploader Picture</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>Now, we need to customise the form we use for editing and uploading ideas.</p>
					<p>We're using the same bit of code to edit and upload. This is found in <code>app/models/idea.rb</code>.</p>
					<p>This code snippet is used in both <code>edit.html.erb</code> and <code>new.html.erb</code>, as the two forms are basically identical. This saves us some work! If you look at either of those pages, <br>rather than form code, it just says <code><%= render 'form' %></code>.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>Open <code>app/models/idea.rb</code>. Under the line <code>class Idea < ActiveRecord::Base</code>, add:

				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>Open <code>app/views/ideas/_form.html.erb</code>. This file creates our form HTML.</p>

				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>Find <code><%= f.text_field :picture %></code> and change it to:</p>

					</section>
					<section data-background="images/halftone.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
						<p>Let's take a closer look at <code>app/views/ideas/show.html.erb</code>.</p>
						<p>
						In the code <code><%= @idea.picture %></code>, @idea is what we call an 'instance variable'. Instance variables are start with an @ symbol. Each view file (what we're looking at now), has a corresponding controller action, where the instance variables' are set.</p>
						<p>In our code, @idea is set in the â€˜showâ€™ action of the Ideas controller. It's set with the code <code>@idea = Idea.find(params[:id])</code>.</p>
						<p>This allows us to use it in the view <code>show.html.erb</code>. It uses the Rails 'Find' method to get the ideas for our app from our database.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/halftone.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
						<p>The code that follows the <code>@idea</code> variable (<code>.picture</code>) tells Rails to access the â€˜pictureâ€™ attribute of our resource (idea). </p>
						<p>Our new code, <code><%= image_tag(@idea.picture_url...)</code>, uses the Ruby image_tag helper. This gives us an HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, but retrieves the image we want to display from the folder 'public/images' where our uploaded images are stored.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/halftone.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
						<p>We also set a default width for each image (<code>width: 600</code>).</p>
						<p>The final part of that line of code, <code>if @idea.picture.present?</code> checks if there is an image available before executing the code before it.</p>

				<!-- Routes -->
				<section class="title" data-background="images/red-hearts.png" >
					<h2>Fine-tuning the routes</h2>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>One part of our app's job is to listen to requests from the browser and return the correct information. In Rails, we have a system called 'routing' that does this.</p>
					<p>The browser requests information using HTTP* methods. There are four main methods it uses:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>GET</li>
						<li>PUT</li>
						<li>POST</li>
						<li>DELETE</li>
					</ul>
					<p><small>*HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) defines how information is formatted and transmitted on the Internet.</small></p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>Rails' routing system ensures the app knows what to do when it receives each of those methods for any of the resources in your app.</p>
					<p>For example, <code>GET /ideas/new</code> will give you the form for adding a new idea.</p>
					<p><code>POST /ideas</code> will create a new idea.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>We're going to change some of the routes we have set up. When you open the localhost:3000 page, it still has the Ruby 'Welcome Aboard' message. <br>We had to manually go to /ideas.</p>
					<p>Open <code>config/routes.rb</code>. After the first line, add:</p>
					<pre><code>root to: redirect('/ideas')</code></pre>
					<p>This changes the default page (root) that is returned when a browser requests your app to the /ideas page. Try it out now (don't forget to save your changes first, and <br>restart the server if you've stopped it).</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>Lastly, we're going to add a static page to our app. This one is going to <br>provide information about the author of the app - you!</p>
					<p>In the terminal, type:</p>
					<pre><code>rails generate controller pages info</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>This created a new folder called 'pages', which you can find under <code>app/views</code>.</p>
					<p>In that folder, you'll see a page called <code>info.html.erb</code>. Open it up.</p>
					<p>You can customise the information in this page. <br>If you add /pages/info to your app URL now, you'll see this page.</p>

					<p>This creates a new repository (a place to store your app). It then initializes the repository, which allows you to record revisions of the project, and finally, it creates a read-me document.

				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">
					<p>Go back to Nitrous.io. Make sure you're still in your project directory.</p>

					<p>The <code>.</code> means all files. So, this command will get us ready to add all our files to our computer's repository.</p>
					<p>Git has an intermediary stage before it saves any changes. This is called 'staging', and it allows you to make sure everything is correct, so you can commit (save) them.</p>

					<p>You're now ready to make your first commit! In the terminal, type:</p>

					<p>This commits all of your files to your computer's git repository. The words between the <code>"</code><code>"</code> is your commit message. This tells other people looking at your code what you are doing.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/brushed.png" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px">							<p>Now, you need to send the code to GitHub, so you can share it and collaborate on it if you want. In the terminal type:</p>
					<pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yournewrepositoryname.git</code></pre>
					<p>This makes a remote connection to the GitHub repository you've typed. We normally call this 'origin', as it's the original version.</p>
